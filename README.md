# UFOs

## Project Overview
Dana has asked our team to assist in creating a dynamic webpage of UFO data. Dana has asked our team to build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array, create filters to make a table fully dynamic, and present the table on a HTML page for easy viewing. To provide an in-depth analysis of the UFO data, Dana would like to be able to filter the UFO table by:
- Date
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape
## Resources
- - Data Source: data.js, starter_code.js
- - Software: JavaScript, Bootstrap, D3, HTML
## Results 
Based on the results of the above listed summaries our team was able to compare the results to our original summaries to see how the removal of the Thomas High School 9th graders reading and math scores affected the following:
1.	The District Summary
2.	The School Summary
3.	Thomas High schools overall Performance
4.	Math and reading scores by grade
5.	Math and reading scores by school size
6.	Math and reading scores by type
### The District Summary
Below is our original District Summary

Shown below is he updated District Summary with the Thomas High School 9th grader grades removed 
![ New_District Summary]( https://github.com/lmacera/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources%202/New_District%20Summary.PNG )

**Results:**
-	Total School Count, Total Students, and Total budget were unchanged.
-	Average Reading Score remained unchanged.
-	The Average Math Score, Percentage Passing Math, Percentage Passing Reading, and Overall percentage Passing Math and Reading, saw a slight downturn by approximately 0.02%
### The School Summary
Below is our original School Summary.

Below is the updated School Summary with the Thomas High School 9th grader grades removed. 
![New_School_Summary]( https://github.com/lmacera/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources%202/New_School_Summary.PNG )

**Results:**
-	Only difference between the two summaries was in Thomas High School results.
-	For the Thomas High School information, the Total Students, Total Budget, and Per Student Budget remained the same.
-	For The Thomas High School scores and score percentages there was a slight downturn.
-	Between the Average Math and Reading score the Average Math Score decreased the most with an approximate 0.06% decrease, thus the Percentage Passing Math and the Overall Percentage of Reading and Math dropped similarly. 
-	If we look at the School Summary before removing the Thomas High School 9th graders from the count then we see that the Passing and Overall Percentages of Thomas High School were between 65%-66%, but these low percentages were driven by the 9th graders being included in the total count driving down the overall average. See below image that demonstrates what Thomas High school math and reading percentage passing scores were before removing the 9th graders form the count.

### Thomas High schools Overall Performance
As shown in the images below removing the 9th graders math and reading scores from the dataset did not change how Thomas High School a ranked among the 15 schools in the data set. Thomas High School still ranked as the second highest school in terms of the Overall Passing Percentage.

### Math and Reading Scores by Grade
From the below images we can see the only change is scores by grade was that Thomas High School 9th grade scores are now 0. Removing the Thomas High School 9th graders did not change 10th – 12th grade scores at Thomas High School, nor did it change the 9th-12th grade scores at any other school.

## Summary
In summary, not many aspects of our analysis changed after removing the 9th grader math and reading scores of the Thomas High School students. From the District Summary analysis, we can see the items that decreased were the Total Average Math and Reading Scores, Total Percentage Passing Math and Reading, and the Overall Percentage Passing both Math and Reading. Additionally, with the School Summary analysis we can see Thomas High Schools Average Math and Reading Scores, Percentage Passing Math and Reading, and the Overall Percentage Passing both Math and Reading decreased. Though these items decreased from our original analysis the amounts did not decrease significantly.
